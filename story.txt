	There once was a man named Boba.  He did not drink tea.  He did not like to be solo. So he took a sky walk into a pit.
Once he finish his sky walk, he fly towards moon.

The moon was not a friendly place to Boba. Besides there being no air, there were no bounties ot collect. Even worse, the gravity was too low and when he turned on his jetpack he reached escape velocity and was on his way to the edge of the observable universe.
