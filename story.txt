	There once was a man named Boba.  He did not drink tea.  He did not like to be solo. So he took a sky walk into a pit.

Once he finish his sky walk, he fly towards moon.

The moon was not a friendly place to Boba. Besides there being no air, there were no bounties ot collect. Even worse, the gravity was too low and when he turned on his jetpack he reached escape velocity and was on his way to the edge of the observable universe.

Lucky for Boba, he was a very intelligent being. He decided to turn off the jetpack before he flew too far, and changed direction. Although he ablsolutely despised the moon, he headed back anyways because he left all of his stuff there and he really needed his stuff. 'A bounty hunter without his stuff is no bounty hunter at all,' he muttered to himself as he reached the moon, reminding himself of why he decided to come back. 

But on his way back he ran into a blackhole. Unable to escape, Boba was transported to a time long ago in a galexy far far away. Once he arived, he realized there were a lot of bounties is this new universe. However all of his stuff was still on the moon. What ever was he going to do?

In that instant, Mace Windu appeared with the moon and his stuff.  Mace Windu offered Boba his stuff back if Boba agreed to work for the Republic.  Boba declined and Mace Windu quickly left with the moon in tow.  Boba took out his disappointment on all his bounties and lived averagely ever after.
